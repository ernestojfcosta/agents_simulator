A simulator for simple agents

This is a small project whose main intent is to develop a simple framework in Python to make easy the task of doing some simulations with pure reactive (also called reflexive) agents.

Essentially the user can define a 2D world inhabited by different entities (e.g., agents, obstacles, food, ....). Each agent will have a brain, implemented as a production system. The other, non living entities, are simpler, do not change the world by their actions and  will have simple attributes. We can visualize the world.
